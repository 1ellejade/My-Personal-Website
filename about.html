								<p>I am a first-year graduate student at Fordham University at Lincoln Center in New York City pursuing a M.S. in Data Science with a 4.0 GPA, as well as a Research Assistant in the department of Computer and Information Sciences. I recently graduated from Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business with a B.S. in Global Business and Technology and a GPA of 3.97, where I was active on the Dean's Council. </p>
								<p>I was raised on Long Island and have always been enticed by the fast-paced melting pot that is New York. I am a self-taught pianist, and my passion for music led me to perform at Jazz at Lincoln Center in 2017. I also have a love for learning foreign languages—I have intermittently studied European and East Asian languages—which helped to spark an interest in Natural Language Processing in my field, which I hope to explore in future research.</p>
								<p>While at Fordham I have gained first-hand experience working on several teams for extended periods to conduct deep analysis and thorough market research. I refined my research skills during my Sustainability internship with The Estée Lauder Companies and continue to leverage them in my Data Science research with Fordham. Thus far, I have had the opportunity to work on projects spanning optimization, regression models, and graph algorithms, and in the coming semester I'll embark on a new research project to explore the autonomous driving application of federated learning and image processing with TensorFlow. </p>
								<p>Over the summer, I also interned in UX at Cox Automotive, a software development company that serves over 40,000 auto dealers across 5 continents, where I conducted qual and quant research as a Product Manager. I am continuing to pursue internships and full-time opportunities in New York that intersect my interests and give me hands-on experience working with data in the quickly evolving tech industry.</p>
								<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
