								<h3>Fordham University, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</h3>
								<h4><em>M.S. Data Science</em></h4>
								<p>GPA: 4.0/4.0
								<br><strong>Activities: </strong><a href="experience.html">Research Assistant</a>
								<br><strong>Relevant Coursework: </strong>Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Computing, Data Mining, Mathematics for Data Science, Python Programming
								<br>I began my graduate coursework as an undergraduate student, and during this time became an assistant researcher at the graduate school. My research has explored optimization, power resilience, and inequity, and has allowed me to sharpen my skills in regression and machine learning.
								From this research, two papers were completed and submitted for publishing. I have had the opportunity to work on several class projects as well, spanning greedy algorithms and statistical analysis. In the Spring 2023 semester, I will embark on a new project on Federated Learning, as well as a Thesis project on Natural Language Processing.</p>

								<h3><br>Fordham University, Gabelli School of Business</h3>
								<h4><em>B.S. Global Business, Technology</em></h4>
								<p>GPA: 3.97/4.0

								<br>At the start of my journey at Fordham, I was selected by the Gabelli School Dean to represent the student body, organize and report on school events and student involvement, and drive productive change for students as a member of the Gabelli School Dean's Council.
								In this role, I also participated as a mentor in the Gabelli Freshman Mentor program for three years to propel incoming freshmen toward success and act as a resource for answering inquiries. 
								I was also one of 11 students selected from the council to serve on the dean selection committee, which gave me the privilege of meeting with and giving input with regards to the Gabelli School Dean candidates.</p>
